         NEWCALC:name  TO OPEN UP A NEW CALCULATOR
         NEWPROGRAM:name TO WRITE A NEW PROGRAM

         IN THE CALCULATOR MODE:

              Any alphanumeric phrase can serve as a variable.
              To return an entry from the log, type @line@.

              ALL to show the log
              
        IN THE PROGRAMMABLE MODE:

        SLOTH is basically a very basic basic.
        COMMANDS INCLUDE:
               PRINT expression
               PRINTLINE expression
               GOTO line#                  
               WHILE conditionalexpression 
               ENDWHILE
               IFSKIP conditionalexpression /If TRUE, then skip the next line
               END
               IS                           /ALTERNATIVE FORM
                                            /OF VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT
                                            /YOU can also use '='
        SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
               inputfloat('PROMPT')
               inputstring('PROMPT')
        INTERPRETER OPERATION
               line numbers can be entered explicitly or implicity
               RUN to run a program for the first time.
               RERUN to run again without reinterpreting
               CLEAR to clear program
               ALL to show program
               CALC:name to return to calc mode
               TRACE to show the trace stack
               DELETE to delete a line

         EXAMPLES

         1) HELLO WORLD
            10 PRINT 'HELLO WORLD'

         2) CALCULATE FIBONACCI NUMBERS

          10 PRINTLINE 'FIBONACCI'
          20 LIMIT = inputfloat('LIMIT?')
          30 OLD=0
          40 NEW=1
          50 COUNTER = 1
          60 WHILE COUNTER<LIMIT
          70 NEWER=OLD+NEW
          80 OLD=NEW
          90 NEW=NEWER
          100 COUNTER=COUNTER+1
          110 PRINT 'VALUE='
          120 PRINTLINE NEW
          130 ENDWHILE
          140 PRINTLINE 'LIMIT'
          150 PRINT LIMIT
